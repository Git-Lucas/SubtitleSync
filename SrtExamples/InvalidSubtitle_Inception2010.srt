2
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,071
Hey! Come here! We have a man on the shore!
I'm on my way.

3
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:58,735
Are you here to kill me?

4
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:08,787
I know what this is.

5
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:13,826
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

6
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:21,008
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

7
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:27,339
A man possessed of some radical notions.

8
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:37,103
What is the most resilient parasite?
Bacteria? A virus?

9
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:40,676
An intestinal worm?

10
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:44,438
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...
- An idea.

11
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,252
Resilient. Highly contagious.

12
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:51,449
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

13
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:55,507
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood that sticks.

14
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,061
- Right in there somewhere.
- For someone like you to steal?

15
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:01,908
Yes. In the dream state, your
conscious defense is lowered

16
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,864
and it makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.
It's called extraction.

17
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,432
Sir Saito, we can train your
subconscious to defend itself from even

18
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:12,958
- the most skilled extractor.
- How can I do that?

19
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:16,185
Cause I am the most skilled extractor.

20
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:18,492
I know how to search your
mind and find your secrets.

21
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:22,527
I know the tricks. And I can teach them
to you so even when you're asleep

22
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:25,603
your defense is never down.

23
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,601
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

24
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:32,339
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife

25
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:35,833
better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

26
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,418
If this is a dream and you
have a safe full of secrets

27
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,721
I need to know what's in that safe.

28
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:45,152
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

29
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:51,725
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.
But I'll consider your proposal.

30
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:55,930
He knows.

31
00:03:57,823 --> 00:04:00,506
What's going on up there?

32
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,113
Saito knows.
He's playing with us.

33
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:56,650
It doesn't matter.
I can get it here. Trust me.

34
00:04:56,652 --> 00:05:00,927
The information is in the safe.
He looked right at it when I mentioned "secrets".

35
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:04,154
What's she doing here?

36
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:08,088
Just head back to the room, alright.
I'll take care of this.

37
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,103
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

38
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:22,806
If I jump, would I survive?

39
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,998
A clean dive, perhaps.
Mal, what are you doing here?

40
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,679
I thought you might be missing me.

41
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:36,667
You know that I am.
But I can't trust you anymore.

42
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,331
So what?

43
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:41,627
Looks like Arthur's taste.

44
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:45,941
Actually, the subject is partial
disposal of British painters.

45
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,278
Please, have a seat.

46
00:05:56,601 --> 00:06:00,278
Tell me...
Did the two kids miss me?

47
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:06,400
You can't imagine.

48
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:14,461
- What are you doing?
- Getting some fresh air. Stay where you are, Mal.

49
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,891
Goddamn it.

50
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:33,308
- Turn around.
- Put the gun down.

51
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,551
Please.

52
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:55,455
Now, the envelope Mr. Cobb.

53
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:59,043
Did she tell you?
Have you known all along?

54
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,666
That you're here to steal from me
or that we are actually asleep?

55
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:10,518
I want to know the
name of your employer.

56
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:15,689
There's no use in threatening
within a dream right, Mal?

57
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:21,858
That depends on what you're threatening.
Killing him will just wake him up.

58
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:24,114
But pain...

59
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,161
Pain is in the mind and judging by
the decor we're in your mind right, Arthur?

60
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:47,519
- What are you doing? It's too soon!
- I know. But the dream has collapsed.

61
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:51,542
Just try to keep Saito lie a little bit longer.
We're almost there.

62
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:06,922
This place.
The paintings.

63
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:23,791
Stop him!

64
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:50,486
I think that's gonna work.
Wake him up!

65
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,272
You awake!

66
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:18,182
- Give him the kick!
- What?

67
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,943
Drop him.

68
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:03,825
He's up.

69
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:10,473
You came prepared, hmm?

70
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:12,802
Not even my head of security
knows this apartment.

71
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,964
How did you find it?

72
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,215
It's very difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret

73
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:20,803
particularly when there's a
married woman involved.

74
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,462
- She will never...
- Yet, here we are.

75
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:26,326
- For the dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

76
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:29,050
- You got what you need.
- Well, it's not true.

77
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:31,601
You left out a key piece
of information, didn't you?

78
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:34,841
You held something back because
you knew what we were up to.

79
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:36,991
Question is why do
you let us in at all?

80
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:39,662
- An audition.
- An audition for what?

81
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:41,884
Doesn't matter.
You failed.

82
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,646
We extracted every bit of
information you had in there.

83
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:47,099
But your dream approach is obvious.

84
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:28,322
So leave me alone.

85
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:32,455
You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.
The operation that hired us...

86
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,963
they won't accept failure.
We won't last two days.

87
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,044
Cobb?

88
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:42,358
Looks like I'm gonna have to
do this a little more simply.

89
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:47,036
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

90
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,152
I've always hated this carpet.

91
00:12:53,467 --> 00:13:02,551
It stain and fade in such distinctive ways.
That way you know it's made of wool.

92
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,988
But now...

93
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:08,573
...a line of polyester.

94
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:16,166
Which means I'm not lying on
my carpet in my apartment.

95
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:22,716
You have lived after your reputation, Mr. Cobb.
I'm still dreaming.

96
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,702
- Where did he go?
- We're not getting paid.

97
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:39,801
Dream within a dream, huh.
I'm impressed.

98
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:44,364
But in my dream,
you play by my rules.

99
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,799
- Yes, but you see Mr. Saito...
- We're not in your dream.

100
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:50,471
We're in mine.

101
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:01,111
Asshole.
How did you mess up the carpet?

102
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:03,528
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

103
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,933
- I don't know he's gonna rub his damn cheek on it!
- That's enough.

104
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,211
- You, what the hell is all that?
- I have it under control.

105
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,889
I didn't see it under control.

106
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:16,572
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

107
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,756
Why?
We still have to check every compartment.

108
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,100
I don't like trains.
Listen.

109
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:23,964
Every man for himself.

110
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,330
- Yes, hello.
- Hi, daddy.

111
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,280
<i>Hi, dad..</i>

112
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,745
Hey guys, hey.
How are you? How are you doing, huh?

113
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:43,905
<i>Good.
- Okay, I guess.</i>

114
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:52,014
- Okay? Who's just okay? Is that you, James?
- Yeah, when are you coming home, dad?

115
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,406
Well, I can't sweetheart. I can't.

116
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:58,808
- It's not for a while, remember?
- Why?

117
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:04,128
I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

118
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:07,766
Grandma says you're
never coming back.

119
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:12,710
Phillipa, is that you?
Put grandma on the phone for me, will you?

120
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:15,789
She's shaking her head.

121
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:19,349
Let's just hope she's wrong about that.

122
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:22,802
- Daddy?
- Yeah, James?

123
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:25,342
<i>Is Mommy with you?</i>

124
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:32,690
James, we've talked about this.
Mommy's not here anymore.

125
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,982
<i>Where?</i>

126
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,071
<i>That's enough, kids.
Say bye bye..</i>

127
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:42,457
Listen, I wanna send some
presents with grandpa, alright?

128
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:45,391
And you be good... you be...

129
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,549
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Alright.

130
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:05,597
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

131
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,750
- Why?
- Locked down in a dream, Mal showing up.

132
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:11,454
Sorry about your leg,
it won't happen again.

133
00:17:11,456 --> 00:17:12,791
It's getting worse, isn't it?

134
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:15,056
One apology is all
you're getting huh, Arthur.

135
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:17,739
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

136
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:20,941
No, we're supposed to go over Saito's
expansion plans in Cobol Engineering

137
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:24,988
two hours ago. By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

138
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,968
- Where would you even go?
- Buenos Aires.

139
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:31,380
I'll cut my load, I may slip out a
job when things quiet down.

140
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,657
- You?
- States, sir.

141
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:36,497
Send my regards.

142
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:45,479
He sold the art. Fell off the company
and bargained for his life.

143
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:50,035
So I offer you the satisfaction.

144
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,335
It's not the way I deal with things.

145
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:09,109
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

146
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:12,707
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

147
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:29,114
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

148
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,666
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

149
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:36,701
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind
why can't you plant one idea instead.

150
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:39,891
Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.
I say to you...

151
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:41,572
"Don't think about elephants".

152
00:18:41,574 --> 00:18:43,369
- What are you thinking about?
- Elephants.

153
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:46,697
Right. But it's not your idea
because you know I gave it to you.

154
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:49,931
The subject's mind can always
trace the genesis of the idea.

155
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:53,185
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- It's not true.

156
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:58,270
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

157
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,075
Cause I can find my own
way to square things with Cobol.

158
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:05,314
- You don't need to have a choice.
- And I choose to leave, sir.

159
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:13,158
Tell the crew where you want to go.

160
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,386
Hey, Mr. Cobb!

161
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:24,701
How would you like to go home?
To America?

162
00:19:24,984 --> 00:19:28,357
- To your children?
- Can't fix that!

163
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:31,610
- No one can!
- Just like inception.

164
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:34,495
Cobb, come on.

165
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,558
How complex is the idea?

166
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,868
- Simple enough.
- No idea is simple...

167
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:43,515
when you need to plant it
in somebody else's mind.

168
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:46,945
My main competitor is an
old man in poor health

169
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:51,216
His son will soon inherit
control of the corporation.

170
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:55,170
I need him to decide to
break up his father's empire.

171
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:59,521
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

172
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:05,244
If I were to do this... If I even could do it
I need a guarantee

173
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,114
How do I know you can deliver?

174
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:08,952
You don't

175
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:15,352
But I can.
So, do you want to take a leap of faith?

176
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:22,352
Or become an old man filled
with regrets, waiting to die alone?

177
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:29,548
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

178
00:20:37,142 --> 00:20:40,306
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

179
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:44,719
- But this can't be done.
- Yes, it can.

180
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:48,597
- You just have to go deep enough.
- You don't know that.

181
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:51,723
I've done it before.

182
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,195
Who'd you do it to?

183
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:01,369
Are we going to Paris?

184
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:05,085
We're gonna need a new architect.

185
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:22,725
You never did like your office, did you?

186
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:26,795
No space to think in
that room covered.

187
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:30,940
Is it safe for you to be here?

188
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:35,740
Extradition between France and the United States
is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.

189
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:38,737
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case

190
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:43,457
Look, I.. brought this for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

191
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:46,336
It will take more than the
occasional stuffed animal

192
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:49,072
to convince those children
they still have a father.

193
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:50,357
I'm just doing what I know.

194
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:53,902
- I'm doing what you taught me.
- I never taught you to be a thief.

195
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:57,354
No, you taught me to navigate people's
minds but after what happened

196
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,416
They wanna hold our legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

197
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:08,683
What are you doing here, Dom?

198
00:22:09,357 --> 00:22:11,451
I think I found a way home.

199
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:15,319
It's a job for some very very
powerful people.

200
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:18,781
People who I believe can
fix my charges permanently..

201
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:24,766
- But I need your help.
- You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.

202
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:28,047
You know what I'm offering.
You have to let them decide for themselves.

203
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:32,174
- Money.
- Not just money. You remember. It's...

204
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,571
the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities, things that never existed.

205
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:39,350
Things that couldn't exist in the real world.

206
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:44,596
So, you want me to let someone
else follow you into your fantasy.

207
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:48,339
They don't actually come in to the dream.
They just design the levels...

208
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:49,797
and teach them to the dreamers.
That's all.

209
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:53,208
Design it yourself.

210
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,705
Mal won't let me.

211
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:05,536
Come back to reality, Dom.
Please.

212
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:12,010
Those kids, your grandchildren-
they're waiting for their father to come back home.

213
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:17,689
That's their reality. And this job,
this last job that's how I get there.

214
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:21,042
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

215
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:27,498
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

216
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:34,673
I got somebody better.
Ariadne?

217
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,332
I'd like you to meet, Mr. Cobb.

218
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,761
- Please to meet you.
- If you have a few moments...

219
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:45,400
Mr. Cobb has a job offer
he'd like to discuss with you.

220
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:48,064
- Is the work pretty soon?
- Not exactly.

221
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,236
- I have a test for you.
- You're not gonna tell me anything about this first?

222
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:55,047
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

223
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:58,524
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

224
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:06,264
Two minutes, design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

225
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,373
Stop.

226
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,523
Again.

227
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,843
Stop.

228
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:21,259
You have to do better than that.

229
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:35,547
That's more like it.

230
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:57,664
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true
potential. Now, that's when we're awake.

231
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,012
When we're asleep, the mind
can do almost anything.

232
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:03,643
- Such as?
- Well, imagine you're designing a building, right?

233
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,989
You consciously create each aspect.

234
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:09,499
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself. If you know what I mean.

235
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:14,056
- Yeah, yeah. Like, uhmm, discovering.
- Genuine inspiration, right?

236
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:18,198
Now in a dream, our mind
continuously does this. We...

237
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:22,526
create and perceive our world simultaneously.

238
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:23,965
And our mind does this so well

239
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:25,898
that we don't even know it's happening.

240
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,803
That allows us to get right
into the middle of that process.

241
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:31,225
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

242
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:35,058
Now, this is where I need you.
You create the world of the dream.

243
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,432
We bring the subject into that dream.

244
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,981
And they feel it's their subconscious.

245
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:45,093
How can I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality.

246
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:48,448
Well, dreams they feel
real while we're in them, right?

247
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:53,050
It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

248
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:58,149
Let me ask you a question. You never really
remember the beginning of a dream, do you?

249
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,277
You always wind up right in
the middle of what's going on.

250
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,398
- I guess, yeah.
- So how did we end up here?

251
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,208
- Well, we just came from the...
- Think about it, Ariadne.

252
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:11,796
How did you get here?
Where are you right now?

253
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,353
- We're dreaming?
- You're actually in the middle of the workshop right now, sleeping.

254
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:22,600
And this is your first lesson in
shared dreaming, so there you go.

255
00:26:58,422 --> 00:27:00,924
If it's just a dream
then why are you...

256
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:03,973
It's never just a dream, is it?
When your face is full of glass

257
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:06,806
feels like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

258
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:09,639
It's what the military developed.
During that time, it was a training program

259
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,155
for soldiers to shoot and stab and
strangle each other and then wake up?

260
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:15,882
How did architects think they belong?

261
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:18,115
Well, someone had to
design the dreams, right?

262
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:22,618
- Why don't you give us another five minutes?
- Five minutes?

263
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:26,865
We were talking for like at least an hour.

264
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,380
In a dream, your mind functions
more quickly therefore...

265
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:31,920
time seems to feel more slow.

266
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:34,566
Five minutes in the world
gives you an hour in the dream.

267
00:27:36,186 --> 00:27:38,194
Why don't we see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

268
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:47,572
We got the basic layout.
Bookstore, cafe.

269
00:27:47,601 --> 00:27:48,990
Almost everything else is here to.

270
00:27:49,137 --> 00:27:52,407
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

271
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:54,853
- Yours?
- Yes. Remember, you are the dreamer.

272
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,649
You built this world. I am the
subject, my mind populates it.

273
00:27:58,765 --> 00:28:00,897
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

274
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,153
That's one of the ways we extract
information from a subject.

275
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,524
- How else do you do it?
- By creating something secure, like a...

276
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:09,188
like a bank vault or a jail.

277
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,775
The mind automatically fills it with
information it's trying to protect.

278
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:15,209
- Understand?
- Then you break in and steal it.

279
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:17,029
Well...

280
00:28:17,048 --> 00:28:22,573
I guess I thought that the dream space should
be all about the visual but it's more about the feel of it.

281
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:26,905
My question is, what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

282
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:11,119
- Something, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

283
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:36,355
Why are they all looking at me?

284
00:29:36,432 --> 00:29:39,837
Cause my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

285
00:29:39,953 --> 00:29:42,302
The more you change things,
the quicker the projections

286
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:44,048
start to converge them.

287
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,914
- Converge?
- It sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.

288
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:49,998
They attack like white blood
cells fighting an infection.

289
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,991
- Are they going to attack us?
- No. Just you.

290
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:02,062
This is great but I'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this...

291
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:08,873
Jesus. Mind telling your
subconscious to take it easy?

292
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,636
It's my subconscious.
Remember, I can't control it.

293
00:31:03,214 --> 00:31:04,595
Very impressive.

294
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,187
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

295
00:31:19,274 --> 00:31:21,288
Yeah, I cross it everyday
to get to the college.

296
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:23,220
Never recreate places from your memory.

297
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,094
Always imagine new places.

298
00:31:25,206 --> 00:31:26,744
Well, you gotta draft from
stuff you know, right?

299
00:31:26,871 --> 00:31:29,760
Only use details.
A street lamp or a phone booth.

300
00:31:29,964 --> 00:31:31,528
- Never entire areas.
- Why not?

301
00:31:31,816 --> 00:31:34,434
Because building a dream from
your memory is the easiest way

302
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,674
to lose your grasp from what's
real and what is a dream.

303
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:37,953
Is that what happened to you?

304
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:40,088
Listen to me.
This has nothing to do with me, understand?

305
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:42,112
Is that why you need me
to build your dreams?

306
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,074
Get off of her.
Back up.

307
00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:47,360
- Back up!
- Cobb!

308
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:48,793
- Get off me!
- Let me go!

309
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:50,217
- Don't! Mal!
- Cobb!

310
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:51,442
- Mal!
- Wake me up!

311
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:52,777
- Mal!
- Wake me up!

312
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,816
- Mal, No! No!
- Wake me up!

313
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:55,442
Mal, no!

314
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:59,303
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.
You're okay.

315
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:03,270
- You're okay.
- Why... why wouldn't I wake up?

316
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:07,121
Cause there were still some time on the
clock and you can't wake up within a dream

317
00:32:07,171 --> 00:32:08,117
unless you die.

318
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:09,398
- Show me the totem.
- What?

319
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:13,578
- A totem, it's a small, personal...
- That's some subconscious you got on you, Cobb!

320
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:17,432
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh I see, you met Mrs. Cobb.

321
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:20,023
- She's his wife.
- Yeah. So, a totem.

322
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:24,214
You need a small object to potentially have you...
something you have all the time.

323
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:25,094
that no one else knows.

324
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,534
- Like a coin?
- No. It must be more unique than that.

325
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:30,502
This is a loaded die.

326
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:35,303
I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

327
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,816
Only I, know the balance and the
weight of this particular loaded die.

328
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,148
That way, when you
look at your totem,

329
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,411
You know beyond a doubt
that you're not in someone else's dream.

330
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:51,552
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on or if you just don't want to

331
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,904
but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's trying to bury down there.

332
00:32:55,132 --> 00:32:58,616
And I'm not about to just open
my mind to someone like that.

333
00:33:04,543 --> 00:33:08,455
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

334
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,789
Reality is not gonna be enough for her now.
And when she comes back...

335
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:15,794
If she comes back, you're gonna
have her building mazes.

336
00:33:15,845 --> 00:33:17,806
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

337
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:21,484
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's backyard.

338
00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:24,301
- It's a necessary risk.
- There is plenty of good thieves.

339
00:33:24,731 --> 00:33:28,761
We don't just need a thief.
We need a forger.

340
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,968
You can rub them together all you want,
but they're not gonna breed.

341
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,530
- You'll never know.
- Let me get you a drink.

342
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:46,579
You might.

343
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,310
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Test me.

344
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:57,216
How's your handwriting?

345
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,959
- The best in town.
- Good.

346
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,562
Thank you very much.

347
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:01,993
Inception.

348
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:05,992
Now, before you bother
telling me it's impossible...

349
00:34:06,372 --> 00:34:09,061
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

350
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,735
- Interesting.
- So Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.

351
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:15,662
Arthur...
You still work with that stick and mind?

352
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:19,566
- He's good at what he does, right?
- Oh, he's the best. He has no imagination.

353
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:20,421
Not like you.

354
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,195
Listen, if you're gonna perform
inception you need imagination.

355
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,929
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

356
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:30,910
We tried it. We got the idea in
place. But it didn't take.

357
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:33,538
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

358
00:34:34,063 --> 00:34:37,301
You need the simplest version
of the idea in order for it...

359
00:34:37,352 --> 00:34:39,395
to grow naturally in your subjects.
Mind is a very subtle art.

360
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,704
So what is this idea that you need to plant?

361
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:46,421
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

362
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:50,695
Well. you see right there, you have various political
motivations and anti-manipulistic sentiments to set forth.

363
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:55,176
And with all that stuff, it's really
at the mercy of your subject's prejudice.

364
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:58,801
And what you have to do is
start with the absolute basic.

365
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:02,433
- Which is what?
- The relationship with the father.

366
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,856
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

367
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:13,337
Alright, well there is a man here. Yusuf.
He formulate his own versions of the compounds.

368
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,637
- When are you taking me there?
- Once you lost your tail.

369
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:18,626
- Men at the bar.
- Cobol Engineering.

370
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:21,479
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

371
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:23,794
I don't remember.
Let's see if they start shooting.

372
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:26,965
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, in half an hour.

373
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:29,851
- Be back here?
- It's the last place they'd suspect.

374
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,805
Alright.

375
00:35:34,812 --> 00:35:38,202
Freddy! Freddy Simmons.
My God, it's you, isn't it?

376
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:41,455
- Who?
- No, it isn't.

377
00:35:42,591 --> 00:35:44,377
You're not dreaming now, are you?

378
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:03,445
Stay out!

379
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:23,975
No, cafe.
One cafe.

380
00:36:37,227 --> 00:36:38,221
Cafe.

381
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:32,890
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

382
00:37:34,682 --> 00:37:37,800
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I need to protect my investments.

383
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,173
Ah, so this is your idea
of losing your tail, huh.

384
00:37:43,224 --> 00:37:44,548
Different tail.

385
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:54,249
Cobb said you'd be back.

386
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:58,954
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.

387
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,138
It's just... pure creation.

388
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:07,902
Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?
You're gonna have to master a few tricks

389
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,966
if you're gonna build three
complete dream levels.

390
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:12,948
- Excuse me.
- What kind of tricks?

391
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:16,199
In a dream, you can cheat
architecture into impossible shapes.

392
00:38:16,854 --> 00:38:20,581
That lets you create closed loops.
Like the Penrose Steps.

393
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:22,743
Infinite staircase.

394
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,655
See?

395
00:38:31,588 --> 00:38:36,818
Paradox. So a closed loop like that will help you
disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.

396
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,501
How big do these levels have to be?

397
00:38:39,822 --> 00:38:42,535
It could be anything from the
floor of a building to an entire city.

398
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,328
But they have to be complicated enough...

399
00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:45,946
that we can hide from the projection.

400
00:38:45,996 --> 00:38:47,490
- A maze.
- Right, a maze.

401
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:49,921
- And the better the maze...
- Then the longer we have...

402
00:38:49,972 --> 00:38:52,441
- ... before the projections catch us?
- Exactly.

403
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:55,477
My subconscious
seems quiet enough.

404
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:56,786
You wait till it turns ugly.

405
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,798
No one likes to feel someone else
is messing around with their mind.

406
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:02,173
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

407
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,809
I don't know if he can't,
but he won't.

408
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:08,409
He thinks it's safer if
he doesn't know the layouts.

409
00:39:08,522 --> 00:39:10,371
- Why?
- He won't tell me.

410
00:39:10,387 --> 00:39:12,060
But I think it's Mal.

411
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,506
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

412
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:16,939
- They're still together?
- No, she's...

413
00:39:18,364 --> 00:39:19,824
She's dead.

414
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:24,301
What you're seeing there
is just his projection of her.

415
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,484
- What was she like in real life?
- She's lovely.

416
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:37,569
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.

417
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:39,438
To formulate compounds for a job?

418
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:44,331
- And to go into the field with us.
- No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

419
00:39:44,577 --> 00:39:48,225
We'd need you there to tell the
compounds specific to our needs.

420
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,525
- Which are?
- Great depth.

421
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:53,042
A dream within a dream?
Two levels?

422
00:39:55,816 --> 00:39:57,218
Three.

423
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,967
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

424
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:07,513
- It is possible you just had to have a sedative.
- Well, powerful sedative.

425
00:40:09,393 --> 00:40:11,074
- How many team members?
- Five

426
00:40:11,837 --> 00:40:12,413
Six.

427
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:18,174
The only way to know you've
done the job is if I am with you.

428
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:21,085
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

429
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,238
This time, it seems there is.

430
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:27,932
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it everyday.

431
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,537
- What for?
- Yeah, I'll show you.

432
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:39,883
- Perhaps you will not want to see.
- After you.

433
00:40:48,586 --> 00:40:52,497
Six, ten, twelve.
All connected, bloody animal.

434
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:54,036
They come everyday to share the dream.

435
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,841
You see?
Very stable.

436
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:08,592
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.

437
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:11,585
- And the dream time?
- With this compound?

438
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:15,058
- About forty hours, each and every day.
- Why do they do it?

439
00:41:15,143 --> 00:41:16,151
Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

440
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,359
After a while it becomes the
only way you can dream.

441
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,494
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

442
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:26,260
- They come here everyday to sleep?
- No.

443
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:34,168
They come to be woken up.
The dream has become their reality.

444
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:38,592
Who are you to say otherwise, huh?

445
00:41:40,482 --> 00:41:41,745
Let's see what you can do.

446
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,777
You know how to find me.

447
00:41:56,698 --> 00:41:58,855
You know what you have to do.

448
00:42:03,544 --> 00:42:04,822
Sharp enough?

449
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:21,730
Are you alright, Mr. Cobb?

450
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:25,668
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just fine.

451
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,336
Robert Fischer, heir to the
Fischer-Morrow energy conglomerate.

452
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:40,200
What's your problem
with this Mr. Fischer?

453
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:42,235
That's not your concern.

454
00:42:42,286 --> 00:42:46,025
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

455
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:51,344
You asked me for inception. I do hope you
understand the gravity of that request.

456
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:55,651
The seed that we plant in this
man's mind will grow into an idea.

457
00:42:55,705 --> 00:42:58,745
This idea will define him.
It may come to change...

458
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:01,602
It may come to change
everything about him.

459
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:05,382
We're the last company standing between
them and total energy dominance.

460
00:43:05,836 --> 00:43:10,139
We can no longer compete.
Soon, they'll control the energy supply

461
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:13,872
of half the world.
In effect, they become a new superpower.

462
00:43:15,272 --> 00:43:18,236
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

463
00:43:18,658 --> 00:43:23,222
That's where we come in.
How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?

464
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:26,369
Rumor is, the relationship
is quite complicated.

465
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,941
But we can't work based
solely on rumor, can't we?

466
00:43:28,987 --> 00:43:33,853
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning, Fischer Sr's right hand man.

467
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:35,968
Fischer Jr's godfather.

468
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:39,344
It should be possible.
If you can get the right references.

469
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:43,343
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

470
00:43:44,353 --> 00:43:47,613
I'm not smelling settlement here.
Take them down.

471
00:43:47,664 --> 00:43:51,592
Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's
policy is always one of avoiding litigation.

472
00:43:55,906 --> 00:43:59,092
Shall we voice your
concerns with Maurice directly?

473
00:43:59,538 --> 00:44:02,724
- Not sure if that's necessary.
- No, no, no. I think we should.

474
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:28,510
How is he?
I don't wanna bother him unnecessarily, but...

475
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:33,994
Robert, did I tell you to keep out of town...
Wait, just do it.

476
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,030
No, don't speak, Mr. Fischer.

477
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,441
Follow through!

478
00:44:38,684 --> 00:44:42,313
Never.
Never gonna send what I asked.

479
00:44:42,363 --> 00:44:44,676
Leave town.

480
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,701
Terrible.

481
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:53,987
Must be a cherish memory of his.

482
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:58,598
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

483
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:05,159
Robert... we need to talk about the power of attorney.

484
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,591
- I know this is hard right now.
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

485
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:08,322
but it's imperative that we start to...

486
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:14,364
The vultures are circling.

487
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:17,530
The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

488
00:45:18,513 --> 00:45:20,743
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

489
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:25,654
adopt his physical presence,
study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

490
00:45:25,674 --> 00:45:28,882
Now, in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

491
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,750
And suggest concepts to
Fischer's conscious mind.

492
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:35,261
Then, when we take
him a level deeper his own

493
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:38,572
projection of Browning should,
should feedback right back to him.

494
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:41,094
- So he gives himself the idea.
- Precisely.

495
00:45:41,952 --> 00:45:44,384
That's the only way it will stick.
He has to see himself generate it.

496
00:45:44,435 --> 00:45:47,314
Eames, I am impress.

497
00:45:48,116 --> 00:45:51,372
Your confession, has always as
much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

498
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,799
Were you going out there on your own?

499
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:16,675
No, no. I was just...
just running some experiments.

500
00:46:17,494 --> 00:46:19,695
I didn't realize anyone was here.
So...

501
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:23,598
- Yeah, I was just, I was working on my totem actually.
- Here, let me take a look.

502
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:26,837
So you're learning, huh?

503
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:29,932
An elegant solution for
keeping track of reality.

504
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:34,548
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was... it's Mal's, actually.

505
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:39,863
This. This one was hers.
You spin it in a dream and it would never topple.

506
00:46:39,873 --> 00:46:43,187
Just... spin and spin.

507
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:49,462
- Arthur told me she past away.
- How are the mazes coming on?

508
00:46:49,904 --> 00:46:53,028
Each level relates to the part of
the subject's subconscious that...

509
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,463
we are trying to access.

510
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:59,400
So, making the bottom level, hospitals.
So Fischer will bring his father.

511
00:46:59,637 --> 00:47:02,769
Actually I have a question
about this layout.

512
00:47:02,813 --> 00:47:06,824
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

513
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:08,838
Why is that so important?

514
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:10,879
In case one of us brings in our projections

515
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:13,209
we don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

516
00:47:14,152 --> 00:47:16,942
You mean, in case you bring Mal in.

517
00:47:17,149 --> 00:47:20,811
- Well, you can't keep her out, can you?
- Right.

518
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:24,773
You can't build because if you
know the maze then she knows it.

519
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:27,616
Which should sabotage the whole operation.

520
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:29,832
- Cobb, did the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

521
00:47:30,252 --> 00:47:32,209
You gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

522
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,812
No one said it's getting worse.

523
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,402
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

524
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:46,714
- Why can't you go home?
- Because they think I killed her.

525
00:47:49,749 --> 00:47:51,935
- Thank you.
- For what?

526
00:47:52,158 --> 00:47:54,229
For not asking whether I did.

527
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:57,543
That's why we need to plant
it deep in the subconscious.

528
00:47:57,728 --> 00:48:01,235
Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right?
Not reason.

529
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,838
We need to find a way to translate
this into an emotional concept.

530
00:48:04,873 --> 00:48:06,761
How do you translate a
business strategy to an emotion?

531
00:48:07,328 --> 00:48:08,717
That's what we're here to figure out, right?

532
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:12,108
Now, Robert's relationship with his
father is stressed, to say the least.

533
00:48:12,374 --> 00:48:13,520
I can't remember that.

534
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:17,106
Because suggesting him to break up his
father's company is a "screw you" to the old man.

535
00:48:17,285 --> 00:48:18,757
No, cause I think positive emotion...

536
00:48:18,904 --> 00:48:20,818
triumphs negative emotion everytime.

537
00:48:20,908 --> 00:48:23,775
We're all hearing for a reconciliation.
A catharsis.

538
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:28,200
We need Robert Fischer to have a
positive emotional reaction to all this.

539
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:30,155
Alright, well, try this.

540
00:48:30,176 --> 00:48:34,837
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself not follow in his footsteps. "

541
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:37,598
That might work.
Might.

542
00:48:38,078 --> 00:48:39,948
We're gonna need to do a little
better than might.

543
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,479
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

544
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,426
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity,
Eames.

545
00:48:44,598 --> 00:48:47,947
- Specificity?
- Inception is not about being specific.

546
00:48:47,997 --> 00:48:51,125
When we get inside his mind, we're gonna
have to work at what we find.

547
00:48:52,564 --> 00:48:56,091
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father.

548
00:48:56,182 --> 00:48:59,329
And seed...
"I will not follow in my father's footsteps".

549
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:03,879
And the next level down, we feed him with:
"I will create something for myself".

550
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:06,864
By the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

551
00:49:06,868 --> 00:49:09,233
- "My father doesn't want me to be him".
- Exactly.

552
00:49:10,374 --> 00:49:14,406
With three layers down, the dreams are
gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.

553
00:49:14,555 --> 00:49:15,945
Sedation.

554
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,104
For a sleep stable enough to
create three layers of dreaming

555
00:49:19,129 --> 00:49:21,940
we have to combine with
an extremely powerful sedative.

556
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:34,744
Good night.

557
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:37,192
The compound that'll be
used to share the dream

558
00:49:37,243 --> 00:49:39,010
creates avery clear
connection between dreamers

559
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:41,600
plus actually accelerating brain function.

560
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:43,892
In other words, it gives us
more time on each level.

561
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,815
Brain function in the dream
will be about twenty times normal.

562
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:50,261
When you enter a dream within that dream
the effect is compounded.

563
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,004
- It's three dreams, that's 10 hours, that's twenty...
- I'm sorry, math is never my strong subject.

564
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:57,970
- How much time is that?
- It's a week the first level down.

565
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:01,558
Six months the second level
and the third level...

566
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:03,605
Is ten years.

567
00:50:05,189 --> 00:50:07,991
Who would wanna be stuck
in a dream for ten years?

568
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,561
Depends on the dream.

569
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:12,139
So once we've made the plants
how do we get out?

570
00:50:12,141 --> 00:50:15,225
I'm hoping you have something more elegant
in mind than shooting me in the head.

571
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,449
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

572
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:21,562
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

573
00:50:22,631 --> 00:50:24,967
It's that feeling of falling,
you get the jolts, you awaken

574
00:50:25,594 --> 00:50:26,794
snaps you out of the dream.

575
00:50:26,845 --> 00:50:28,516
Are we gonna feel a kick
with this kind of sedation?

576
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,055
Oh, that's the counterpart.

577
00:50:30,107 --> 00:50:32,648
I've customized it to leave
any ear function unimpaired.

578
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:36,915
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

579
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:40,436
Or tipping.

580
00:50:40,843 --> 00:50:42,721
The trick is to synchronize a kick

581
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:45,455
that can penetrate all three levels.

582
00:50:45,548 --> 00:50:48,209
We can use a musical content
to synchronize the different kicks.

583
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,162
He doesn't have any surgery scheduled,
No dental, nothing.

584
00:51:00,235 --> 00:51:02,023
Wasn't he suppose to
have a knee operation?

585
00:51:02,036 --> 00:51:06,890
Nothing. Nothing that will put him under for any REM.
We need... We need at least a good ten hours.

586
00:51:06,948 --> 00:51:08,724
Sydney to Los Angeles.

587
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:13,171
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

588
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,948
And he must be flying private.

589
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:19,416
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

590
00:51:19,751 --> 00:51:21,970
- But that should be a 747.
- Why is that?

591
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,786
Cause in a 747 the pilot's up top

592
00:51:23,934 --> 00:51:27,035
and the first class cabin is in the nose.
So no one would walk through.

593
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,108
But you'd have to buy out the entire cabin.
And the first class flight.

594
00:51:30,218 --> 00:51:35,245
I bought the airline.
It seemed little.

595
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:39,413
Well, looks like we have our ten hours.

596
00:51:40,151 --> 00:51:43,126
Ariadne?
Terrific work, by the way.

597
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:33,990
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.

598
00:52:37,413 --> 00:52:40,585
Do you remember when
you ask me to marry you?

599
00:52:42,024 --> 00:52:46,403
- Of course I do.
- You said you had a dream.

600
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:52,585
That will grow old together.

601
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:56,054
And we can.

602
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:03,260
You shouldn't be here.

603
00:53:07,962 --> 00:53:11,026
I just want to see what kind of tests
you're doing here alone every night.

604
00:53:11,092 --> 00:53:14,122
- Whatever it was, it has nothing to do with you.
- It has everything to do with me.

605
00:53:14,173 --> 00:53:19,139
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.

606
00:53:30,412 --> 00:53:34,440
- Why do you do this to yourself?
- It's the only way I can still dream.

607
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:42,131
- Why is it so important to dream?
- In my dreams, we're still together.

608
00:53:56,104 --> 00:53:59,260
These aren't just dreams.

609
00:53:59,655 --> 00:54:02,581
These are memories and you
said never to use memories.

610
00:54:02,835 --> 00:54:05,720
- I know I did.
- You're trying to keep her alive.

611
00:54:06,207 --> 00:54:10,342
- You can't let her go.
- You don't understand.

612
00:54:10,536 --> 00:54:13,894
These are moments that I regret
and memories that I have to change.

613
00:54:15,614 --> 00:54:17,808
Oh, what's down there that you regret?

614
00:54:17,811 --> 00:54:20,956
Listen, I do know one thing that you
need to understand about me.

615
00:54:29,444 --> 00:54:32,808
- Is this your house?
- Mine and Mal's, yes.

616
00:54:34,102 --> 00:54:38,054
- Where is she?
- She's already died.

617
00:54:42,452 --> 00:54:46,863
That's my son, James. He's digging
for something, maybe a worm.

618
00:54:48,637 --> 00:54:50,359
That's Phillipa.

619
00:54:50,494 --> 00:54:54,964
You see, I thought about calling out to them so
they'd turn and smile and I can those

620
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,273
those beautiful faces of
theirs but... it's all too late.

621
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:02,927
Right now, or never, Cobb.

622
00:55:07,796 --> 00:55:12,527
Then I start to panic. I realized I
don't want to regret this moment that...

623
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:15,070
I need to see their faces one last time.

624
00:55:15,122 --> 00:55:17,637
James! Phillipa!
Come on in!

625
00:55:17,903 --> 00:55:21,235
But the moment's passed.

626
00:55:22,064 --> 00:55:25,344
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

627
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:30,593
So I'm about to call out
to them and run away.

628
00:55:33,071 --> 00:55:36,327
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.

629
00:55:36,722 --> 00:55:38,537
The real world.

630
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:21,835
- What are you doing here?
- My name is...

631
00:56:21,919 --> 00:56:24,885
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

632
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,728
- I'm just trying to understand.
- How could you understand?

633
00:56:38,352 --> 00:56:41,690
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

634
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:46,504
- To be half in a whole?
- No.

635
00:56:48,795 --> 00:56:50,350
I'll tell you a riddle.

636
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:57,669
You're waiting for a train.
A train that will take you far away.

637
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:05,190
You know where you hope this train will take you.
But you don't know for sure.

638
00:57:05,837 --> 00:57:12,161
But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter
to you where the train will take you?

639
00:57:12,255 --> 00:57:13,914
Cause we will be together.

640
00:57:14,317 --> 00:57:17,672
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

641
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:21,139
This is the hotel suite where
we should spend our anniversary.

642
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:22,740
What happened here?

643
00:57:23,557 --> 00:57:27,587
You promised!
You promised we'll be together!

644
00:57:27,674 --> 00:57:29,510
Please, I need you stay here!
Just for now!

645
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,977
You said we'll be together!
You said we'll grow old together!

646
00:57:32,984 --> 00:57:34,992
I'll come back for you.
Promise.

647
00:57:52,453 --> 00:57:57,203
Do you think you can just build a
prison of memories to lock her in?

648
00:57:58,403 --> 00:58:01,639
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

649
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:06,053
It's time.
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

650
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:09,157
- When is the funeral?
- Thursday, in Los Angeles.

651
00:58:09,327 --> 00:58:12,225
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

652
00:58:12,362 --> 00:58:13,755
Right.

653
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:17,217
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles, no.

654
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:20,593
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

655
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,537
And it doesn't have to be me.

656
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:28,304
But then you have to show
Arthur what I just saw.

657
00:58:33,947 --> 00:58:35,839
Get us another seat on the plane.

658
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:42,603
If I get on this plane and you
don't honor our agreement.

659
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:45,682
When we land, I go to jail
for the rest of my life.

660
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:51,087
Complete the job on board.
I'll make one phone call from the plane.

661
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:54,038
You will have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

662
00:58:58,714 --> 00:59:00,701
- Yes, it is.
- Thanks.

663
00:59:00,702 --> 00:59:01,258
Yes.

664
00:59:01,259 --> 00:59:03,470
- Third seat on the right.
- Thanks.

665
00:59:07,539 --> 00:59:10,013
- I'm sorry.
- Oh yeah, I'm sorry, my bad.

666
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,993
- Welcome aboard, sir. May I take your coat?
- Thank you.

667
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:41,513
FASTEN SEAT BELTS.
NO SMOKING.

668
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,753
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must've dropped it.

669
00:59:46,972 --> 00:59:49,506
- Gentlemen, can I have your drink?
- Oh, water please.

670
00:59:49,814 --> 00:59:51,410
The same, please.

671
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:56,337
Thank you.

672
00:59:56,484 --> 00:59:59,823
You know I couldn't help but notice
but you won't happen to be related to...

673
00:59:59,874 --> 01:00:01,510
"The Maurice Fischer", would you?

674
01:00:01,535 --> 01:00:08,751
- Yes, he... he was my father.
- Well he was a very inspiring figure.

675
01:00:08,762 --> 01:00:11,261
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Sir.

676
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:15,087
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

677
01:00:15,303 --> 01:00:20,829
Hey, to your father.
May he rest in peace, huh.

678
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,051
You couldn't have peed
before you went on there.

679
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:28,818
Sorry.

680
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:30,984
Pitching much free champagne
before take off, right, Yusuf?

681
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:31,895
Ha-ha. Bloody hard.

682
01:01:31,945 --> 01:01:34,479
Well now, he's gonna be
looking for a taxi in this weather.

683
01:01:46,648 --> 01:01:49,338
- Asshole! Hey man, why don't you try...
- Walk away.

684
01:02:05,386 --> 01:02:08,803
Look, I gotta go. Alright.
Taxi. Thank you.

685
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,259
Alright. Third and Market. Snappy.

686
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:15,942
What are you doing?

687
01:02:16,308 --> 01:02:17,904
- Oh sorry, I thought it was free.
- Well, it's not.

688
01:02:18,088 --> 01:02:19,841
- Maybe we could share.
- Maybe not.

689
01:02:19,892 --> 01:02:21,409
Can you pull over and get this...

690
01:02:24,376 --> 01:02:25,547
Great.

691
01:02:30,224 --> 01:02:31,753
Come on!

692
01:02:42,942 --> 01:02:45,314
There's $500 in there and
the wallet's worth more than that.

693
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,245
So you might as well
drop me at my stop.

694
01:02:47,308 --> 01:02:48,400
I'm afraid that this...

695
01:02:57,297 --> 01:02:57,873
Cover him!

696
01:02:57,924 --> 01:03:01,043
No! No! No!
What was going on?

697
01:03:04,632 --> 01:03:06,335
This wasn't in my design.

698
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:10,082
Cobb?
Cobb?

699
01:03:58,598 --> 01:03:59,912
Get him!

700
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,827
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

701
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,206
Fischer's okay.
Unless he gets carsick.

702
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:13,398
Saito?

703
01:04:31,377 --> 01:04:32,648
Get Fischer in the back room now!

704
01:04:33,976 --> 01:04:36,744
- Get him the back room.!
- What the hell...

705
01:04:36,812 --> 01:04:38,602
- Has he been shot? Is he dying?
- I don't know.

706
01:04:38,652 --> 01:04:39,452
Jesus Christ.

707
01:04:39,892 --> 01:04:42,547
- Where were you? What happened to you?
- The girl played a freight train.

708
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,703
Why did you put a train crossing
in the middle of a downtown interstate?

709
01:04:44,754 --> 01:04:46,189
- I didn't.
- Where did it come from?

710
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:48,072
Let me ask you a question!
Why the hell were you ambushed?

711
01:04:48,471 --> 01:04:50,960
Those were not normal projections!
They've been trained for God's sakes!

712
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,499
- You're right.
- How can they be trained?

713
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:56,555
Fischer had an extractor that
teaches subconscious to defend itself.

714
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:58,544
So his subconscious is militarized.

715
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,009
It should've shown in the research.
I'm sorry.

716
01:05:00,057 --> 01:05:02,453
- So why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

717
01:05:02,535 --> 01:05:04,836
Don't tell me to calm down.
This was your job, goddamn it!

718
01:05:04,918 --> 01:05:08,782
This was your responsibility! You were meant to
check Fischer's background thoroughly!

719
01:05:08,855 --> 01:05:10,338
We are not prepared for
this type of violence!

720
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:12,126
We have dealt with
self-security before!

721
01:05:12,177 --> 01:05:13,903
We'll be a little more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

722
01:05:14,016 --> 01:05:16,184
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying for God's sake!

723
01:05:16,235 --> 01:05:17,608
- Now, let's put him out of his misery.
- No, no!

724
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:19,095
- Don't do that!
- What's the matter, Cobb?

725
01:05:19,105 --> 01:05:21,803
- Don't do that
- He's in agony, I'm waking him up.

726
01:05:22,412 --> 01:05:25,480
- No, it won't wake him up.
- What do you mean, it won't wake him up?

727
01:05:25,531 --> 01:05:27,851
- It won't wake him up.
- When we die in a dream, we wake up.

728
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:31,500
Not from this. We're too heavily
sedated to wake up that way.

729
01:05:31,591 --> 01:05:34,847
- Right, so what happens when we die?
- We drop in a limbo.

730
01:05:34,914 --> 01:05:36,830
- Are you serious?
- Limbo?

731
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:39,830
- Unconstructed dream space.
- What the hell is down there?

732
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:43,226
Just raw infinite subconscious.
Nothing is down there.

733
01:05:43,311 --> 01:05:45,756
Except for whatever might have been left
behind by anyone sharing the dream

734
01:05:45,807 --> 01:05:49,999
who has been trapped there before.
Which in our case, is just you.

735
01:05:50,064 --> 01:05:51,634
How long can we be stuck there?

736
01:05:51,858 --> 01:05:53,974
I can't even think about trying to
escape until the sedation is...

73
01:05:54,025 --> 01:05:57,004
- How long, Yusuf?
- Decades, It could be infinite. I don't know.

738
01:05:57,055 --> 01:05:58,389
Ask him he's the one who's been there.

739
01:05:58,429 --> 01:06:00,220
Just get him upstairs.

740
01:06:01,306 --> 01:06:04,139
Great.
Thank you.

741
01:06:05,668 --> 01:06:08,871
So, now we're trapped in Fischer's
mind battling his own private army...

742
01:06:08,904 --> 01:06:11,347
and if we get killed,
we'll be lost in limbo

743
01:06:11,398 --> 01:06:13,548
till our brains turn
to scrambled egg, hmm?

744
01:06:19,304 --> 01:06:22,185
You got first aid?

745
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,802
So you knew about this
risk and you didn't tell us?

746
01:06:26,837 --> 01:06:29,748
There weren't meant to be any risk cause
I didn't know we'd be dealing with a load of gunfire.

747
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:32,576
- You had no right
- It was the only way to go three layers deep.

748
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:36,187
- And you, you knew about this and went along with it?
- I trusted him.

749
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:38,059
You trusted him. What?
Did he promise you half his share?

750
01:06:38,075 --> 01:06:41,503
No. His whole share.
It's like he said, he'd done it before.

751
01:06:41,554 --> 01:06:44,468
He'd done it before, what, with Mal?
Cause that worked so good?

752
01:06:44,518 --> 01:06:46,853
It has nothing to do with it. I did what
I had to do to get back to my children.

753
01:06:46,935 --> 01:06:48,748
So you lead us into a
war zone with no way out.

754
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:52,556
There is a way out. Alright, we continue on with
the job and we do this as fast as possible.

755
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:55,605
and we get out using the kick.
Just like before.

756
01:06:55,656 --> 01:06:58,134
Forget it, If we go any deeper
we'll just raise the stakes.

757
01:06:58,201 --> 01:06:59,830
I am sitting this one
out on this level, boys.

758
01:06:59,881 --> 01:07:02,367
Fischer's security is surrounding
this place as we speak.

759
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:04,509
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

760
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:08,866
That means each and every one of
us will be killed. That I can guarantee.

761
01:07:08,906 --> 01:07:12,125
We have no other choice but to
continue on and do it as fast as possible.

762
01:07:13,532 --> 01:07:16,834
Downwards is the only way forward.

763
01:07:17,635 --> 01:07:21,392
Get ready.
You, come on let's go shake him up.

764
01:07:25,929 --> 01:07:29,493
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to ten million.

765
01:07:29,544 --> 01:07:31,800
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up! It won't be.

766
01:07:31,802 --> 01:07:34,982
In your father's office, below the
bookshelf is his personal safe.

767
01:07:35,068 --> 01:07:38,455
- We need the combination.
- I don't know any safe.

768
01:07:38,462 --> 01:07:41,515
It doesn't mean you
don't know the combination.

769
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:46,320
- Tell us what it is.
- I don't know.

770
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:53,763
We have an old good
authority you do know.

771
01:07:53,843 --> 01:07:56,517
Yeah? Who is this authority?

772
01:07:57,232 --> 01:07:59,374
$500, this cost?

773
01:07:59,377 --> 01:08:04,073
- What's inside?
- Cash cards, ID, and this.

774
01:08:08,966 --> 01:08:12,767
- Useful?
- Maybe.

775
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:16,121
- You're on. We've got an hour.
- An hour?

776
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:19,404
I was supposed to
have all night to practice.

777
01:08:19,456 --> 01:08:22,089
Saito wasn't supposed to
be shot in the chest.

778
01:08:22,134 --> 01:08:25,228
We got one hour, now get
use something useful, please.

779
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,924
- What's that?
- Good authority.

780
01:08:33,882 --> 01:08:35,129
Uncle Peter...

781
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:36,114
No, no.

782
01:08:36,165 --> 01:08:40,058
- Just make him stop.
- The combination.

783
01:08:40,091 --> 01:08:43,083
- I don't know it.
- Why does Browning say you do?

784
01:08:43,172 --> 01:08:47,062
I don't know.
Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.

785
01:08:48,484 --> 01:08:51,732
You have one hour.
Start talking.

786
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,671
Are you alright?

787
01:08:55,909 --> 01:08:57,958
Are you okay?

788
01:09:00,309 --> 01:09:04,199
Those bastards bad
at me for two days.

789
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,729
They have someone with access to your father's
office and they're trying to open his safe.

790
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:12,563
- Yeah.
- They said I'd know the combination. But I don't know it.

791
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:15,244
- Yeah, neither do I.
- What?

792
01:09:15,294 --> 01:09:19,646
Maurice told me that when he past,
you were the only to be able to open it.

793
01:09:19,704 --> 01:09:21,600
No, he never gave
me any combination.

794
01:09:21,672 --> 01:09:25,994
Maybe he did, I mean, maybe you just
didn't know it was a combination.

795
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:27,548
Well, what then?

796
01:09:27,582 --> 01:09:29,915
I don't know. Some meaningful
combination of numbers

797
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:33,373
based on your experiences with Maurice.

798
01:09:34,835 --> 01:09:39,646
We didn't have very...
many meaningful experiences together.

799
01:09:39,723 --> 01:09:41,970
Perhaps after your mother died.

800
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:47,583
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

801
01:09:47,844 --> 01:09:55,594
- "Robert, there's really nothing to be said".
- Oh well, he was bad with emotion.

802
01:09:55,596 --> 01:09:58,364
I was eleven, Uncle Peter.

803
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:02,319
- How is he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

804
01:10:02,339 --> 01:10:05,437
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

805
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,476
- And if he dies?
- Worst case scenario?

806
01:10:09,535 --> 01:10:12,398
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

807
01:10:12,472 --> 01:10:18,325
- Cobb, I will still honor the arrangement.
- I appreciate that, Saito.

808
01:10:18,376 --> 01:10:22,277
But when you wake up you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

809
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:24,728
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

810
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:28,710
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

811
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:33,112
- Filled with regret?
- Waiting to die alone.

812
01:10:33,193 --> 01:10:39,324
No, I'll come back.
And we will be alive together again.

813
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:46,116
Breath.

814
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:49,302
These people are gonna kill us if
we don't give them the combination.

815
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:51,686
- They just want a ransom.
- I heard them.

816
01:10:51,735 --> 01:10:55,435
They're gonna whack us in that van
and then drive it into the river.

817
01:10:55,516 --> 01:10:58,837
- Alright. What is in the safe?
- Something for you.

818
01:10:58,917 --> 01:11:03,531
Maurice always said it was
his most precious gift to you.

819
01:11:03,603 --> 01:11:05,203
A will.

820
01:11:05,254 --> 01:11:07,313
Maurice's Will is with Port and Dunn.

821
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:11,072
That's an alternate. This would
supercede the other if you wanted to.

822
01:11:11,155 --> 01:11:13,608
It splits off the component
business of Fischer-Morrow

823
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:16,880
And it'd be the end of the
entire empire as we know it.

824
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:23,353
Destroy my whole inheritance.
Why would he suggest that, you think?

825
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:28,612
I just don't know.
He loved you, Robert.

826
01:11:29,781 --> 01:11:33,040
- In his own way.
- In his own way?

827
01:11:33,775 --> 01:11:38,930
At the end, he called
me into his deathbed

828
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:41,619
And he could barely speak.

829
01:11:42,495 --> 01:11:47,644
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

830
01:11:48,357 --> 01:11:56,934
He pulled me closer.
And I could only make out... one word.

831
01:12:00,173 --> 01:12:02,658
"Disappointed".

832
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,917
When were you in limbo?

833
01:12:10,314 --> 01:12:13,915
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job

834
01:12:13,966 --> 01:12:15,187
but they don't know the truth.

835
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:16,627
Truth? What truth?

836
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:21,002
The truth that at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

837
01:12:21,139 --> 01:12:24,615
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

838
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:27,038
And the truth that as we go
deeper into Fischer

839
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:29,380
we're also going deeper into you.

840
01:12:29,569 --> 01:12:33,761
And I... I'm not sure we're
gonna like what we find.

841
01:12:36,062 --> 01:12:42,413
We were working together. We were exploring
the concept of a dream within a dream.

842
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,848
I kept pushing things. I wanted to go deeper
and deeper. I wanted to go further.

843
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:52,133
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there.

844
01:12:52,226 --> 01:12:55,930
That we could get trapped so deep.
That when we...

845
01:12:55,981 --> 01:12:58,733
when wind up on the
shore of our subconscious

846
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:01,666
we lost side of what was real.

847
01:13:07,478 --> 01:13:10,527
We created.
We built a world for ourselves.

848
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:16,752
We did that for years.
We built our own world.

849
01:13:18,264 --> 01:13:22,609
- How long were you stuck there?
- Something like fifty years.

850
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:31,058
Jesus.
How could you stand it?

851
01:13:31,114 --> 01:13:33,445
It wasn't so bad at first.
Feeling like gods.

852
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:36,498
The problem was that I knew
that none of that was real.

853
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:40,891
Eventually, it has became impossible
for me to live like that.

854
01:13:40,943 --> 01:13:43,411
And what about for her?

855
01:13:46,028 --> 01:13:49,256
She has locked something away.
Something deep inside her.

856
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:56,102
The truth that she once known.
She chose to forget.

857
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:01,106
Limbo became her reality.

858
01:14:02,285 --> 01:14:04,428
What happened when you woke up?

859
01:14:04,597 --> 01:14:08,546
Well, to wake up from that after,
after years, after decades...

860
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,671
to become old souls thrown
back into youth like that...

861
01:14:13,689 --> 01:14:18,321
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

862
01:14:19,323 --> 01:14:25,024
Eventually, she told me the truth.
She was possessed by an idea.

863
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:30,169
This one, very simple idea
that changed everything.

864
01:14:31,107 --> 01:14:33,893
That our world wasn't real.

865
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:38,503
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality, that...

866
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:44,652
in order to get back home...
We had to kill ourselves.

867
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:55,025
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections.

868
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:57,059
That our real children are waiting
for us out there somewhere.

869
01:14:57,109 --> 01:14:59,354
- Look, Cobb! I'm their mother.
- Calm down.

870
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:01,510
Can't you even tell the difference?

871
01:15:01,588 --> 01:15:03,432
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?

872
01:15:03,484 --> 01:15:04,936
Because you don't know you're dreaming!

873
01:15:04,964 --> 01:15:08,623
She was certain there was nothing
I could do, no matter how much I begged...

874
01:15:08,674 --> 01:15:10,804
no matter how much I pleaded.

875
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:16,988
She wanted to do it.
But she could not do it alone.

876
01:15:17,022 --> 01:15:22,821
She loved me too much so...
She came up with a plan on our anniversary.

877
01:15:48,233 --> 01:15:50,778
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

878
01:15:51,183 --> 01:15:55,459
Just step back inside, alright?
Just step back inside now, come on.

879
01:15:55,548 --> 01:16:03,798
- No. I'm going to jump and you're coming with me.
- No, I'm not. But now, you listen to me.

880
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:07,605
If you jump, you're
not gonna wake up, remember?

881
01:16:07,657 --> 01:16:13,313
You're gonna die. Now, just step back inside, come on.
Step back inside so we can talk about this.

882
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:16,494
We've talked enough.

883
01:16:17,085 --> 01:16:20,319
- Mal.
- Come out unto the ledge or I'll jump right now.

884
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:21,620
Okay.

885
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:29,088
We're gonna talk about this.
Alright?

886
01:16:29,655 --> 01:16:34,464
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

887
01:16:35,152 --> 01:16:37,969
I can't. You know,
I can't do that.

888
01:16:38,002 --> 01:16:40,354
Take a second and think
about our children.

889
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:44,733
Think about James.
Think about Phillipa, now.

890
01:16:44,788 --> 01:16:47,589
If I go without you,
they'll take them away, anyway.

891
01:16:47,676 --> 01:16:49,526
What does that mean?

892
01:16:49,578 --> 01:16:51,770
I filed a letter with our attorney

893
01:16:51,821 --> 01:16:54,376
explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.

894
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:59,699
How you threatened to kill me.

895
01:17:01,306 --> 01:17:04,668
- Why did you do that?
- I love you, Dom.

896
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:06,808
Why did you.. why...
why would you do this to me?

897
01:17:06,859 --> 01:17:09,419
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

898
01:17:09,495 --> 01:17:12,502
We're going home.
To our real children.

899
01:17:12,558 --> 01:17:16,274
No, no, no, no, Mal, You listen to me!
Alright? Mal, look at me, please.

900
01:17:16,294 --> 01:17:17,926
You're waiting for a train.

901
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:21,741
- Mal,goddamn it! Don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

902
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,356
- James and Phillipa are waiting for you!
- You know where you hope this train will take you.

903
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,136
- They're waiting for us!
- But you can't know for sure.

904
01:17:27,187 --> 01:17:29,807
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

905
01:17:29,844 --> 01:17:32,773
- Mal, goddamn it!
- Because you will be together.

906
01:17:32,867 --> 01:17:38,751
Sweetheart, look at me!
Mal, no! Jesus Christ!

907
01:17:41,536 --> 01:17:45,148
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

908
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:49,325
That made it impossible for me to try to
explain the nature of her madness.

909
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,456
So, I ran...

910
01:17:51,615 --> 01:17:54,813
Right now, or never, Cobb.

911
01:18:04,468 --> 01:18:06,900
Alright, let's go.

912
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,294
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy myself back ever since.

913
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:14,618
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

914
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:18,483
But you are not responsible for
the idea that destroyed her.

915
01:18:19,123 --> 01:18:21,404
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

916
01:18:21,454 --> 01:18:26,610
you have to forgive yourself.
You're gonna have to confront her.

917
01:18:26,641 --> 01:18:28,612
But you don't have to do that alone.

918
01:18:28,698 --> 01:18:31,040
- No, no, you don't...
- I'm doing it for the others.

919
01:18:31,113 --> 01:18:35,791
Because they have no idea of the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

920
01:18:41,325 --> 01:18:42,699
We have to move.

921
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:46,649
- Time's up.
- Alright. I don't know any combination.

922
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:49,976
- Not consciously anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?

923
01:18:50,168 --> 01:18:52,878
I got somebody standing in
front of his office right now

924
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:54,167
ready to tap in the combination.

925
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:57,173
I need the first six numbers that
come to your head right now.

926
01:18:57,207 --> 01:18:59,060
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

927
01:18:59,121 --> 01:19:05,866
- I said right now! Right now!
- 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 1.

928
01:19:09,106 --> 01:19:10,941
You'd have to do better than that.

929
01:19:10,951 --> 01:19:15,176
Alright. Gag him.
We're going for a ride.

930
01:19:18,351 --> 01:19:22,883
What more do you like?
To kill me?

931
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:29,378
What did you get?

932
01:19:29,383 --> 01:19:32,159
That boy's relationship with his father
is even worse than we imagined.

933
01:19:32,194 --> 01:19:32,999
This helps us how?

934
01:19:33,337 --> 01:19:35,735
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

935
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:39,762
How are you gonna reconcile
then pursue his strengths?

936
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:41,636
- Well I'm working on that, don't I?
- Move fast.

937
01:19:41,685 --> 01:19:43,515
Projections are closing in quick.

938
01:19:44,162 --> 01:19:47,133
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

939
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,164
Damn it.

940
01:20:22,215 --> 01:20:24,921
You mustn't be afraid to
dream a little bigger, darling.

941
01:20:41,025 --> 01:20:44,123
Now, we need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

942
01:20:44,177 --> 01:20:46,104
We're gonna destroy his
one positive relationship?

943
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:47,836
No, we'll repair his relationship with his father

944
01:20:47,887 --> 01:20:50,329
by exposing his godfather's true nature.

945
01:20:50,361 --> 01:20:53,895
We should thrice Fischer's
loot more than Saito's mission.

946
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:56,232
What about his security?
It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.

947
01:20:56,283 --> 01:20:59,042
- No, I think we're going with Mr. Charles.
- No.

948
01:20:59,127 --> 01:21:00,796
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- A bad ides.

949
01:21:00,869 --> 01:21:02,744
The second we get into that
hotel and approach Fischer

950
01:21:02,795 --> 01:21:06,836
his security will be all over us.
We run with Mr. Charles like we did on this timed job.

951
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:08,943
- So, you've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't worked.

952
01:21:08,987 --> 01:21:11,966
The subject realized that he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

953
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,506
Excellent.
But you've learned a lot, right?

954
01:21:13,556 --> 01:21:15,494
I need some kind of distraction.

955
01:21:15,545 --> 01:21:18,420
No problem. How about a
lovely lady that I've used before?

956
01:21:18,471 --> 01:21:20,503
- Listen to me. You drive carefully, alright?
- Yeah.

957
01:21:20,529 --> 01:21:23,208
getting down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

958
01:21:27,144 --> 01:21:30,853
Don't jump too soon. We only have one
shot at that kick you're gonna make.

959
01:21:30,884 --> 01:21:33,262
I'll play the music and you'll know
it's coming, the rest is on you.

960
01:21:33,732 --> 01:21:35,737
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

961
01:21:36,863 --> 01:21:38,059
Sweet dreams.

962
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:39,647
Am I boring you?

963
01:21:41,054 --> 01:21:44,976
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

964
01:21:46,938 --> 01:21:48,393
I have a lot in my mind.

965
01:21:49,658 --> 01:21:51,925
There goes Mr. Charles.

966
01:21:56,195 --> 01:21:58,760
Mr. Fischer, right?

967
01:21:59,133 --> 01:22:02,075
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing.

968
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:05,750
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

969
01:22:09,196 --> 01:22:10,877
In case you get bored.

970
01:22:15,741 --> 01:22:17,094
She must have blown you off.

971
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:20,130
That is unless her phone
number really is only six digits.

972
01:22:20,153 --> 01:22:21,360
<i>528-491</i>

973
01:22:21,411 --> 01:22:25,580
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing their wallet like that.

974
01:22:28,984 --> 01:22:31,313
Goddamn it.
The wallet alone is worth at least...

975
01:22:31,844 --> 01:22:33,228
$500, right?

976
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:36,218
Listen, don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

977
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:38,148
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

978
01:22:38,175 --> 01:22:41,730
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

979
01:22:42,002 --> 01:22:43,510
And why don't you approve?

980
01:22:43,522 --> 01:22:45,502
Cause it involves telling
the mark that he's dreaming

981
01:22:45,552 --> 01:22:47,870
which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

982
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:49,937
So Cobb said he couldn't do that?

983
01:22:49,972 --> 01:22:52,872
So now you've noticed
how much time Cobb spends

984
01:22:52,924 --> 01:22:55,419
doing things he says never to do.

985
01:22:56,883 --> 01:22:58,727
Mr. Saito, may I have a moment?

986
01:22:58,777 --> 01:23:01,076
- I'm sorry, but...
- Wait!

987
01:23:01,829 --> 01:23:05,763
- You looked to be "livelier".
- Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

988
01:23:11,864 --> 01:23:13,504
Turbulence on the plane?

989
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:17,053
No, I mean, it's must closer.
It's Yusuf's driving.

990
01:23:24,655 --> 01:23:29,016
- I'm sorry, who did you say you were?
- Rod Green from marketing.

991
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:31,705
That's not true at all, is it?

992
01:23:33,112 --> 01:23:36,476
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

993
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:39,131
I'm the head of your security down here.

994
01:23:39,151 --> 01:23:41,793
Get out on a different floor and keep moving.

995
01:23:41,798 --> 01:23:44,218
Dump the wallet.
The security will look for that.

996
01:23:44,581 --> 01:23:47,742
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a lot more time.

997
01:23:51,016 --> 01:23:52,684
Security, huh?

998
01:23:54,185 --> 01:23:56,937
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

999
01:23:57,059 --> 01:24:03,414
I specialize in a very specific type of security.
Subconscious security.

1000
01:24:03,453 --> 01:24:08,796
Are you talking about dreams?
Are you talking about extraction?

1001
01:24:08,873 --> 01:24:13,666
I am here to protect you.
Look...

1002
01:24:17,898 --> 01:24:20,006
<i>Excellent work.
Now, what is your plan?...</i>

1003
01:24:23,887 --> 01:24:25,845
Mr. Fischer, I am here to
protect you in the event

1004
01:24:25,896 --> 01:24:29,686
that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1005
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:34,795
You're not safe here.
They're coming for you.

1006
01:24:52,389 --> 01:24:54,529
Strange weather, isn't it?

1007
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:01,550
You feel that?

1008
01:25:01,637 --> 01:25:03,126
What's happening?

1009
01:25:03,358 --> 01:25:06,201
Cobb is drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream

1010
01:25:06,252 --> 01:25:08,922
which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1011
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:12,360
For me.
Quick, give me a kiss.

1012
01:25:17,059 --> 01:25:20,490
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it's worth a shot.

1013
01:25:20,594 --> 01:25:22,997
We should probably get out of here.

1014
01:25:38,149 --> 01:25:41,656
Feel that? You've actually been
trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1015
01:25:41,712 --> 01:25:45,329
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shifting gravity.

1016
01:25:45,363 --> 01:25:48,965
None of this is real.
You're in a dream.

1017
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:55,379
Now, the easiest for you to test yourself...

1018
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:59,088
is to try to remember how you arrived at this hotel.
Can you do that?

1019
01:25:59,509 --> 01:26:01,576
See, I don't, I...

1020
01:26:01,799 --> 01:26:04,126
Breath, breath.
Remember your training.

1021
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:07,545
Accept the fact that you're in a dream
and I'm here to protect you.

1022
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:08,835
Go on.

1023
01:26:14,906 --> 01:26:17,750
- You're not real?
- No, no.

1024
01:26:17,896 --> 01:26:20,397
I'm a projection of your subconscious.

1025
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:25,030
I was sent here to protect you in the event
that extractors try to pull you into a dream.

1026
01:26:25,481 --> 01:26:28,639
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1027
01:26:29,276 --> 01:26:33,398
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1028
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:41,992
- Can you get me out of here?
- Right away, follow me.

1029
01:26:54,843 --> 01:26:56,366
Stay there.

1030
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,791
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1031
01:27:02,834 --> 01:27:05,078
These men were sent
here to abduct you, alright.

1032
01:27:05,099 --> 01:27:08,446
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1033
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:12,733
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1034
01:27:22,795 --> 01:27:26,749
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1035
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:28,806
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer.

1036
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:34,356
I believe they have you sedated and if you
pull that trigger, you may not wake up.

1037
01:27:34,433 --> 01:27:39,408
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1038
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:43,390
You remember the training.

1039
01:27:43,506 --> 01:27:47,019
Remember what I said to you.
Give me the gun.

1040
01:27:57,811 --> 01:27:59,972
This room should be directly below 528?

1041
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:01,719
Yeah.

1042
01:28:09,643 --> 01:28:14,862
Think, Mr. Fischer, think
what do you remember from before this dream?

1043
01:28:15,105 --> 01:28:20,112
There was... there was a lot of gunfires.
And there's... rain.

1044
01:28:20,589 --> 01:28:24,326
Uncle Peter.
Oh my God, we've been kidnapped.

1045
01:28:24,384 --> 01:28:26,783
Where were they holding you?

1046
01:28:29,161 --> 01:28:32,314
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1047
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:34,563
You're in the back of a van right now.
Keep going.

1048
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:39,921
It had something to do with...
something to do with a safe?

1049
01:28:40,701 --> 01:28:42,391
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1050
01:28:42,466 --> 01:28:44,856
It's like trying to remember a
dream after you've woken up.

1051
01:28:44,904 --> 01:28:47,373
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1052
01:28:47,434 --> 01:28:49,752
You and Browning has
been pulled into this dream...

1053
01:28:49,803 --> 01:28:52,164
because they're trying to
steal something from your mind.

1054
01:28:52,215 --> 01:28:55,636
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1055
01:28:55,935 --> 01:28:57,431
What is it, Mr. Fischer?
Think!

1056
01:28:57,482 --> 01:28:59,102
A combination.

1057
01:28:59,153 --> 01:29:01,827
They demanded the first
numbers to pop into my head.

1058
01:29:01,878 --> 01:29:04,271
They're trying to extract the
number from your subconscious.

1059
01:29:04,322 --> 01:29:07,404
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1060
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:11,715
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1061
01:29:11,766 --> 01:29:14,462
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1062
01:29:14,464 --> 01:29:16,745
Five.

1063
01:29:16,796 --> 01:29:19,429
Five, two...
It was something.. it was a long number.

1064
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,590
That's good enough.
We could start there.

1065
01:29:20,784 --> 01:29:22,623
- Fifth floor.
- Yup.

1066
01:29:22,674 --> 01:29:26,584
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1067
01:29:26,635 --> 01:29:30,182
While you're all asleep in 528,
I'll wait for Yusuf's kick.

1068
01:29:30,233 --> 01:29:32,166
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1069
01:29:32,217 --> 01:29:35,691
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1070
01:29:35,935 --> 01:29:39,294
So we get a nice, synchronized kick.

1071
01:29:39,345 --> 01:29:41,606
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.

1072
01:29:41,657 --> 01:29:44,768
If it's too late...
I won't be able to drop us.

1073
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:46,128
Why not?

1074
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:50,978
Cause of the van, that will be in free fall.
Can't drop you without gravity.

1075
01:29:51,171 --> 01:29:52,839
Right.

1076
01:29:57,215 --> 01:30:00,515
You're with me.
Go on.

1077
01:30:23,072 --> 01:30:25,543
- Mr. Charles
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?

1078
01:30:25,594 --> 01:30:29,281
- Yeah, I think so, yeah.
- They were trying to put you under.

1079
01:30:29,447 --> 01:30:31,529
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1080
01:30:31,581 --> 01:30:34,658
What do you mean?
A dream within a dream?

1081
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:37,413
Hey. I see you've changed.

1082
01:30:37,415 --> 01:30:39,321
I'm sorry.

1083
01:30:39,468 --> 01:30:43,249
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've mistaken you for a friend.

1084
01:30:44,494 --> 01:30:47,056
Good looking fella, I'm sure.

1085
01:30:48,212 --> 01:30:52,123
That's Fischer's projection of Browning.
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.

1086
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:54,557
- Why?
- Because how he acts would tell us...

1087
01:30:54,559 --> 01:30:57,606
if Fischer is going to suspect his motives,
the way we wanted to.

1088
01:31:02,752 --> 01:31:05,887
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

1089
01:31:05,889 --> 01:31:08,908
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1090
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:11,701
And you saw them torture him?

1091
01:31:17,608 --> 01:31:21,834
- The kidnappers are working for you?
- Robert.

1092
01:31:21,836 --> 01:31:25,885
You're trying to get that safe open?
So you get the alternate will?

1093
01:31:25,887 --> 01:31:29,942
Fischer-Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

1094
01:31:29,944 --> 01:31:32,385
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.
Why would I?

1095
01:31:32,387 --> 01:31:36,961
I couldn't let you rise to
your father's last taunt.

1096
01:31:37,356 --> 01:31:40,273
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert, that will.

1097
01:31:40,275 --> 01:31:42,373
That's his last insult.

1098
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:46,100
A challenge for you to
build something for yourself...

1099
01:31:46,102 --> 01:31:50,286
by telling you you're not
worthy of his accomplishments.

1100
01:31:54,807 --> 01:31:58,301
What, that he was disappointed, hmm?

1101
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:01,148
I'm sorry.

1102
01:32:01,534 --> 01:32:04,634
But... he's wrong.

1103
01:32:05,364 --> 01:32:07,880
You can build a better
company than he ever did.

1104
01:32:07,931 --> 01:32:10,291
Mr. Fischer?
He's lying!

1105
01:32:10,342 --> 01:32:12,415
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1106
01:32:12,467 --> 01:32:15,397
He's hiding something and
we need to find out what that is.

1107
01:32:16,652 --> 01:32:20,120
I need you to do the same thing to
him that he was going to do to you.

1108
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:25,750
We'll enter his subconscious and find
out what he doesn't want you to know.

1109
01:32:27,492 --> 01:32:29,644
Alright.

1110
01:32:34,599 --> 01:32:35,435
He's out.

1111
01:32:35,437 --> 01:32:38,116
Wait, whose subconscious
are we going into exactly?

1112
01:32:38,168 --> 01:32:39,529
We're going into Fischer's.

1113
01:32:39,581 --> 01:32:42,251
But I told him it was Browning's
so he can be a part of our team.

1114
01:32:42,302 --> 01:32:44,471
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1115
01:32:44,523 --> 01:32:45,504
That's right.

1116
01:32:45,843 --> 01:32:48,456
Security's gonna run you down, huh.

1117
01:32:48,508 --> 01:32:50,964
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1118
01:32:51,016 --> 01:32:52,640
Just be back here for the kick.

1119
01:32:52,644 --> 01:32:54,439
Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1120
01:32:58,598 --> 01:33:00,501
Are you good?

1121
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:07,313
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes. I'm.. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1122
01:33:19,535 --> 01:33:24,420
Cobb? Cobb?
What's down there?

1123
01:33:27,285 --> 01:33:29,674
Hopefully the truth we
want Fischer to learn.

1124
01:33:29,726 --> 01:33:32,241
I mean, what's down there for you?

1125
01:35:55,937 --> 01:35:57,328
Did you see that?

1126
01:36:15,343 --> 01:36:17,212
Eames, this is your dream.

1127
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:20,112
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, you understand?

1128
01:36:20,165 --> 01:36:22,256
- Who will guide Fischer in?
- Not me.

1129
01:36:22,308 --> 01:36:24,661
Find all the route,
everything could be compromised.

1130
01:36:24,713 --> 01:36:27,414
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

1131
01:36:27,468 --> 01:36:29,170
I could do it.

1132
01:36:29,221 --> 01:36:31,754
Alright, you'll reach on the
route into the complex.

1133
01:36:31,839 --> 01:36:34,403
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- Alright.

1134
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:38,914
- What about you?
- Keep this alive. I'll be listening in the whole time.

1135
01:36:38,966 --> 01:36:40,895
The windows on that upper
floor are big enough for me...

1136
01:36:40,946 --> 01:36:42,686
to cover you from that south tower.
You see it?

1137
01:36:42,739 --> 01:36:45,554
- Yeah. You're not coming in?
- In order to find out the truth...

1138
01:36:45,605 --> 01:36:48,869
about your father, you're gonna need to
break into Browning's mind on your own.

1139
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,912
Come, Fischer!

1140
01:37:44,963 --> 01:37:48,687
Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!

1141
01:37:48,739 --> 01:37:49,722
Move!

1142
01:37:51,817 --> 01:37:53,367
Go!

1143
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:09,207
So they're shooting me!

1144
01:38:18,889 --> 01:38:20,457
I hope they're ready.

1145
01:38:29,341 --> 01:38:31,414
It's too soon.

1146
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:38,323
Cobb, do you hear that?

1147
01:38:38,410 --> 01:38:41,638
First heard it about twenty minutes ago.
I thought it was the wind up here.

1148
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:44,182
Yeah, I hear it.
It's music.

1149
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:47,356
- So what do we do?
- Move fast.

1150
01:38:52,389 --> 01:38:54,509
Yusuf's ten seconds for the jump.

1151
01:38:56,356 --> 01:38:58,337
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1152
01:38:59,641 --> 01:39:02,124
Hey!

1153
01:39:02,177 --> 01:39:03,854
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1154
01:39:03,906 --> 01:39:05,454
Can they make that
route in under an hour?

1155
01:39:05,524 --> 01:39:07,371
They still have to climb
down to the middle terrace.

1156
01:39:07,422 --> 01:39:09,591
Well then, they need a new route.
A more direct route.

1157
01:39:20,998 --> 01:39:22,583
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1158
01:39:22,634 --> 01:39:25,205
There must be access where
we can cut through the maze, right?

1159
01:39:25,258 --> 01:39:26,920
Eames?

1160
01:39:49,031 --> 01:39:49,923
Did Eames add any features?

1161
01:39:49,975 --> 01:39:51,890
I don't think I should tell you.
If Mal finds out...

1162
01:39:51,941 --> 01:39:54,525
We don't have time for this.
Did he add any?

1163
01:39:54,577 --> 01:39:56,971
He added an air duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1164
01:39:57,023 --> 01:39:58,245
Good. Explain it to them.

1165
01:39:58,296 --> 01:39:59,802
- Saito?
- Go ahead.

1166
01:40:31,436 --> 01:40:33,546
Paradoxical.

1167
01:41:40,093 --> 01:41:42,946
- What was that?
- The kick.

1168
01:41:43,562 --> 01:41:46,438
- Cobb, did we miss it?
- Yeah, we missed it.

1169
01:41:46,449 --> 01:41:51,327
Couldn't you instead just have
dreamt of a goddamn beach?

1170
01:41:53,984 --> 01:41:56,074
What the hell do we do now?

1171
01:41:56,222 --> 01:41:58,278
We finish the job before the next kick.

1172
01:41:58,330 --> 01:42:01,014
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1173
01:42:23,014 --> 01:42:25,311
<i>If wanna make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

1174
01:42:25,363 --> 01:42:27,148
<i>If you need assistance...</i>

1175
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:30,813
How do I drop you without gravity?

1176
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:35,838
Arthur has a couple of minutes,
we have about twenty.

1177
01:42:58,231 --> 01:42:59,784
Are you okay?

1178
01:43:04,485 --> 01:43:07,355
Move out!
To the base!

1179
01:43:11,611 --> 01:43:14,441
There's something wrong. They're heading
your way like they know something.

1180
01:43:16,304 --> 01:43:19,227
Just buy us some more time, alright?
Come on!

1181
01:43:19,663 --> 01:43:21,671
On my way.

1182
01:44:56,516 --> 01:44:58,829
That's the antechamber,
it's just stronger.

1183
01:44:58,881 --> 01:45:00,297
Was it stronger if it have any windows?

1184
01:45:00,349 --> 01:45:01,777
No, I mean it wouldn't
be very strong if it did.

1185
01:45:01,829 --> 01:45:04,227
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1186
01:45:05,891 --> 01:45:07,729
Are those projections part
of his subconscious?

1187
01:45:07,973 --> 01:45:09,415
Yes.

1188
01:45:09,563 --> 01:45:10,949
Are you destroying
those parts of his mind?

1189
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:13,090
No, no.
They're just projections.

1190
01:45:37,181 --> 01:45:38,599
We're here.

1191
01:45:38,651 --> 01:45:41,755
You're clear but hurry.
There's an entire army headed your way.

1192
01:46:06,785 --> 01:46:08,492
We're in.

1193
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:58,378
- There's someone else in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap, get out!

1194
01:47:00,230 --> 01:47:02,226
Come on. A little lower.

1195
01:47:06,854 --> 01:47:12,945
- Cobb. No, she is not real!
- How do you know that?

1196
01:47:12,997 --> 01:47:16,744
She is just a projection.
Fischer... Fischer is real!

1197
01:47:20,595 --> 01:47:22,171
Hello.

1198
01:47:26,819 --> 01:47:29,919
Eames! Eames!
Get to the antechamber now!

1199
01:48:11,582 --> 01:48:14,024
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1200
01:48:16,655 --> 01:48:18,820
I couldn't shoot her.

1201
01:48:18,969 --> 01:48:20,647
But there's no use in reviving him...

1202
01:48:20,698 --> 01:48:24,749
his mind's already trapped down there.
It's all over.

1203
01:48:25,186 --> 01:48:27,278
So that's it?
Then we failed?

1204
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:29,940
We're done.
I'm sorry.

1205
01:48:33,021 --> 01:48:36,350
Well, it's not me who's gonna
get back to my family, is it?

1206
01:48:36,595 --> 01:48:38,569
It's a shame, I really want to know
what's gonna happen in there.

1207
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:41,904
- I swear we have this one..
- Let's set the charges.

1208
01:48:43,976 --> 01:48:46,007
No, there's still another way.

1209
01:48:46,443 --> 01:48:48,721
We just have to follow
Fischer down there.

1210
01:48:48,773 --> 01:48:49,880
We don't have time.

1211
01:48:50,027 --> 01:48:53,508
No, but there will be enough
time down there.

1212
01:48:53,848 --> 01:48:54,989
And we will find him.

1213
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:59,226
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1214
01:48:59,278 --> 01:49:02,849
We can give him his
own kick down below.

1215
01:49:02,901 --> 01:49:04,372
Look you get him in there.

1216
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:07,258
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital.

1217
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:10,448
And we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1218
01:49:11,467 --> 01:49:12,989
That's worth a shot.

1219
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,095
And Saito can hold the guards
out while I set the charges.

1220
01:49:16,147 --> 01:49:18,460
Saito, will never make it, will he?

1221
01:49:19,267 --> 01:49:21,644
Cobb, come on!
We've got to try.

1222
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:22,680
Let's go!

1223
01:49:23,021 --> 01:49:25,481
Look if we're not that fully kicked,
I am gonna leave in vain.

1224
01:49:25,533 --> 01:49:28,024
She's right.
She's right.

1225
01:49:33,018 --> 01:49:34,614
Can I trust you to do what's
gonna happen here?

1226
01:49:34,666 --> 01:49:36,248
I mean, Mal's gonna
be down there.

1227
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:38,562
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1228
01:49:38,614 --> 01:49:40,282
How do you know?

1229
01:49:40,334 --> 01:49:44,985
She wants me to come after her,
she wants me back down there with her.

1230
01:50:10,785 --> 01:50:12,356
Are you alright?

1231
01:50:18,472 --> 01:50:21,154
- This is your world?
- Was.

1232
01:50:22,026 --> 01:50:23,890
This is where she'll be.

1233
01:50:24,648 --> 01:50:26,343
Come on.

1234
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:13,283
Saito...

1235
01:51:13,335 --> 01:51:17,090
I need you... I need you to take care of
Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?

1236
01:51:17,142 --> 01:51:20,634
No room for tourists on this jobs.

1237
01:51:22,221 --> 01:51:24,809
Don't be silly.

1238
01:51:55,521 --> 01:51:57,789
You built all these?
This is incredible.

1239
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,765
We built for years.

1240
01:52:00,775 --> 01:52:03,357
We started in on the memories.

1241
01:52:09,402 --> 01:52:10,999
This way.

1242
01:52:50,525 --> 01:52:54,610
This is our neighbourhood.
The place is from my past.

1243
01:52:54,856 --> 01:52:59,178
That was our first apartment and we
moved to that building right there.

1244
01:52:59,421 --> 01:53:01,894
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1245
01:53:01,945 --> 01:53:04,724
You reconstructed all
of these from memory?

1246
01:53:04,871 --> 01:53:07,135
Like I told you, we have lots of time.

1247
01:53:07,186 --> 01:53:08,816
What is that?

1248
01:53:09,539 --> 01:53:12,022
It's the house Mal grew up with.

1249
01:53:12,073 --> 01:53:14,126
- Will she be in there?
- No.

1250
01:53:14,466 --> 01:53:15,982
Come on.

1251
01:53:16,034 --> 01:53:19,154
We both wanted to live in a house
but we love this type of building.

1252
01:53:19,207 --> 01:53:22,076
In the real world, we'd have
to choose, but not here.

1253
01:54:00,955 --> 01:54:03,267
How are you gonna bring Fischer back?

1254
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,717
I'm gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1255
01:54:05,768 --> 01:54:07,482
What?

1256
01:54:07,919 --> 01:54:09,117
The improvised.

1257
01:54:09,266 --> 01:54:13,478
Listen, there's something you should know about me.
About inception.

1258
01:54:26,161 --> 01:54:29,904
An idea is like a virus.
Resilient.

1259
01:54:30,865 --> 01:54:32,160
Highly contagious.

1260
01:54:32,321 --> 01:54:35,806
The smallest seed of an idea can grow.

1261
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:41,531
It can grown to define or destroy you.

1262
01:54:44,033 --> 01:54:49,808
The smallest idea such as:
"Your world is not real".

1263
01:54:49,859 --> 01:54:53,690
Simple. little thought
that changes everything.

1264
01:54:54,433 --> 01:54:58,923
So certain of your world.
Of what's real?

1265
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:01,607
Do you think he is?

1266
01:55:02,505 --> 01:55:06,190
Why do you think
he's as lost as I was?

1267
01:55:06,308 --> 01:55:09,190
I know it's real, Mal.

1268
01:55:09,963 --> 01:55:12,546
No creeping doubts?

1269
01:55:12,695 --> 01:55:15,551
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1270
01:55:15,603 --> 01:55:19,408
Chased around the globe by anonymous
corporations and police forces?

1271
01:55:19,556 --> 01:55:23,021
The way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1272
01:55:23,654 --> 01:55:24,784
Admit it.

1273
01:55:26,529 --> 01:55:28,623
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1274
01:55:29,296 --> 01:55:32,612
So choose.
Choose to be here.

1275
01:55:33,473 --> 01:55:34,697
Choose me.

1276
01:55:59,764 --> 01:56:02,858
You know what I have to do,
I have to get back to our children...

1277
01:56:02,893 --> 01:56:03,977
because you left them.

1278
01:56:04,669 --> 01:56:07,304
- Because you left us.
- You're wrong.

1279
01:56:07,432 --> 01:56:09,894
- Not at all.
- You're confused.

1280
01:56:09,929 --> 01:56:11,276
Our children are here.

1281
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:15,109
And you'd like to see their
faces again, wouldn't you?

1282
01:56:15,884 --> 01:56:18,638
Yes, but I want to see
them up above, Mal.

1283
01:56:31,851 --> 01:56:33,087
Up above?

1284
01:56:34,747 --> 01:56:39,267
Listen to yourself.
These are our children. Watch.

1285
01:56:40,562 --> 01:56:42,267
James?
Phillipa?

1286
01:56:42,351 --> 01:56:44,950
Don't do this, Mal, please.
Those aren't my children.

1287
01:56:45,036 --> 01:56:47,252
You keep telling yourself
that but you don't believe it.

1288
01:56:47,341 --> 01:56:49,185
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1289
01:56:50,066 --> 01:56:50,880
What if I'm what's real?

1290
01:56:53,506 --> 01:57:00,865
You keep telling yourself what you know.
But what do you believe? What do you feel?

1291
01:57:02,382 --> 01:57:03,767
Guilt.

1292
01:57:05,325 --> 01:57:06,877
I feel guilt, Mal.

1293
01:57:08,410 --> 01:57:12,247
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

1294
01:57:12,297 --> 01:57:16,450
no matter how confused...
that guilt is always there.

1295
01:57:16,501 --> 01:57:18,956
reminding me of the truth.

1296
01:57:18,996 --> 01:57:22,263
What truth?

1297
01:57:23,106 --> 01:57:28,154
The idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

1298
01:57:31,154 --> 01:57:34,127
You planted the idea in my mind?

1299
01:57:35,076 --> 01:57:36,931
What is she talking about?

1300
01:57:37,632 --> 01:57:42,661
The reason I knew inception was
possible was because I did it to her first.

1301
01:57:43,489 --> 01:57:46,570
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1302
01:57:47,094 --> 01:57:49,121
We were lost in here.

1303
01:57:49,267 --> 01:57:53,671
I knew we needed to escape
but she wouldn't accept it.

1304
01:57:56,728 --> 01:58:02,890
She had locked something away,
something... something deep inside.

1305
01:58:02,941 --> 01:58:07,271
The truth that she had once
known but she chose to forget.

1306
01:58:07,868 --> 01:58:09,851
She couldn't break free.

1307
01:58:12,664 --> 01:58:15,123
So I decided to search for it.

1308
01:58:15,859 --> 01:58:20,589
Going deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1309
01:58:20,646 --> 01:58:25,684
I broke in and I planted an idea.

1310
01:58:25,736 --> 01:58:30,130
A simple idea that I knew
would change everything.

1311
01:58:34,601 --> 01:58:36,974
That her world wasn't real.

1312
01:58:48,841 --> 01:58:51,839
That death was the only escape.

1313
01:58:59,071 --> 01:59:01,108
You're waiting for a train..

1314
01:59:02,499 --> 01:59:05,226
A train that will take you far away...

1315
01:59:07,006 --> 01:59:09,594
You know where you hope
this train will take you.

1316
01:59:10,598 --> 01:59:12,735
But you can't know for sure!

1317
01:59:13,788 --> 01:59:15,710
And it doesn't matter!

1318
01:59:16,342 --> 01:59:20,082
- Now tell me why!
- Because we'll be together.

1319
01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:28,241
And I never knew that... that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

1320
01:59:28,293 --> 01:59:32,044
that even after she woke.

1321
01:59:32,672 --> 01:59:37,079
...that even after yo
came back to reality

1322
01:59:37,768 --> 01:59:41,403
that you keep to believe
your world wasn't real.

1323
01:59:43,655 --> 01:59:46,452
That death was the only escape.

1324
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:48,743
Mal, no!
Jesus!

1325
01:59:48,986 --> 01:59:52,544
- You're infecting my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1326
01:59:52,597 --> 01:59:56,434
You betrayed me but you
can make amends.

1327
01:59:56,485 --> 01:59:58,379
You can still keep your promise.

1328
01:59:58,430 --> 02:00:04,198
We can still be together right here.
In the world we built together.

1329
02:01:21,185 --> 02:01:24,119
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1330
02:01:24,363 --> 02:01:26,564
You can't have him.

1331
02:01:26,711 --> 02:01:28,897
If I stay here, will you let him go?

1332
02:01:28,949 --> 02:01:31,316
What are you talking about?

1333
02:01:34,234 --> 02:01:36,708
Fischer's on the porch.

1334
02:01:36,759 --> 02:01:39,060
- Go check if he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1335
02:01:39,112 --> 02:01:42,095
Go check if he's alive, right now!
Do it.

1336
02:01:56,818 --> 02:01:59,907
He's here and it's time
but you have to come now!

1337
02:02:00,045 --> 02:02:04,133
- Take Fischer with you, alright?
- You can't stay here to be with her!

1338
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:08,862
I'm not. Saito's dead
by now that means...

1339
02:02:09,010 --> 02:02:12,773
he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1340
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,154
I can't stay with her anymore
because she doesn't exist.

1341
02:02:17,206 --> 02:02:21,015
I'm the only thing you
do believe in anymore.

1342
02:02:22,737 --> 02:02:25,024
I wish...

1343
02:02:25,941 --> 02:02:29,020
I wish more than anything, but...

1344
02:02:29,264 --> 02:02:31,802
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity.

1345
02:02:31,852 --> 02:02:33,906
All your perfection.
All your imperfection.

1346
02:02:35,655 --> 02:02:36,807
Are you alright?

1347
02:02:36,859 --> 02:02:39,431
Look at you.

1348
02:02:39,771 --> 02:02:44,817
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1349
02:02:44,869 --> 02:02:48,156
And you are the best
that I could do, but...

1350
02:02:48,207 --> 02:02:50,651
...I'm sorry, you're just
not good enough.

1351
02:02:51,256 --> 02:02:52,804
This will feel real?

1352
02:02:54,463 --> 02:02:57,555
- What are you doing?
- Improvise.

1353
02:03:05,048 --> 02:03:06,711
No, no, no!

1354
02:03:07,664 --> 02:03:09,641
Get in there, now!
Go, go, go!

1355
02:03:54,146 --> 02:03:57,100
Disappointed...

1356
02:03:58,182 --> 02:03:59,325
Disappointed...

1357
02:03:59,376 --> 02:04:02,065
I know, Dad.

1358
02:04:07,412 --> 02:04:12,004
I know you were disappointed.
I couldn't be you.

1359
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:15,938
No, no, no!...

1360
02:04:16,066 --> 02:04:23,385
I was disappointed that you tried.

1361
02:04:54,576 --> 02:04:56,462
Come on, come on, come on!

1362
02:05:19,218 --> 02:05:21,236
Dad?

1363
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:05,842
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1364
02:06:18,033 --> 02:06:21,429
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1365
02:06:21,576 --> 02:06:24,070
I will!

1366
02:07:01,107 --> 02:07:04,487
Do you remember when
you asked me to marry you?

1367
02:07:04,826 --> 02:07:05,738
Yes.

1368
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:10,555
You said you dreamt that
we'll grow old together.

1369
02:07:11,103 --> 02:07:13,586
But we did.

1370
02:07:14,333 --> 02:07:17,529
We did, you don't remember?

1371
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:24,601
I'd miss you, more
than I can bear, but...

1372
02:07:26,254 --> 02:07:29,373
...we had our time together.

1373
02:07:29,434 --> 02:07:33,246
And I have to let you go.

1374
02:07:33,297 --> 02:07:36,585
I have to let you go.

1375
02:08:24,110 --> 02:08:25,916
I'm sorry, Robert.

1376
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:55,465
You know, the Will means that
dad wanted me to be my own man.

1377
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:59,144
Not just to live for him.

1378
02:09:00,015 --> 02:09:02,720
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1379
02:09:11,633 --> 02:09:13,386
What happened?

1380
02:09:13,437 --> 02:09:15,227
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1381
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:18,325
No, to find Saito.

1382
02:09:18,761 --> 02:09:21,412
He'll be lost.

1383
02:09:22,638 --> 02:09:25,489
No, he'll be alright.

1384
02:09:39,986 --> 02:09:42,877
Are you going to kill me?

1385
02:09:45,682 --> 02:09:48,787
I'm waiting for someone.

1386
02:09:52,435 --> 02:09:56,559
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1387
02:09:57,554 --> 02:10:02,830
Cobb?
Impossible.

1388
02:10:03,233 --> 02:10:06,585
We were young men together.

1389
02:10:07,253 --> 02:10:10,285
I'm an old man...

1390
02:10:10,432 --> 02:10:14,193
Filled with regret.

1391
02:10:15,538 --> 02:10:19,203
Waiting to die alone, huh.

1392
02:10:21,301 --> 02:10:31,034
I've come back for you...
To remind you of something.

1393
02:10:33,239 --> 02:10:36,534
Something you once knew.

1394
02:10:38,399 --> 02:10:41,431
That this world is not real.

1395
02:10:45,181 --> 02:10:50,482
To convince me to
honor our arrangement?

1396
02:10:50,630 --> 02:10:54,251
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1397
02:10:58,817 --> 02:11:06,635
Come back, so we can be
young man together again.

1398
02:11:09,384 --> 02:11:15,474
Come back with me.
Come back.

1399
02:11:25,142 --> 02:11:27,117
Hot towel, sir?

1400
02:11:27,169 --> 02:11:30,168
We'll landing in Los Angeles
in about twenty minutes.

1401
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:33,175
Do you need immigration forms?

1402
02:11:34,385 --> 02:11:36,110
Thank you.

1403
02:11:36,162 --> 02:11:39,107
- Hot towel, sir?
- Oh no.

1404
02:11:39,158 --> 02:11:41,051
Do you need immigration forms?

1405
02:12:49,910 --> 02:12:53,346
- Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
- Thank you, sir.

1406
02:13:35,542 --> 02:13:38,792
Welcome home.
This way.

1407
02:13:58,750 --> 02:14:03,438
James?
Phillipa?

1408
02:14:06,124 --> 02:14:08,501
Look who's here!

1409
02:14:14,865 --> 02:14:17,928
Hey kids, how are you?

1410
02:14:17,980 --> 02:14:20,859
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1411
02:14:21,007 --> 02:14:22,752
Look what I built, Daddy!

1412
02:14:22,803 --> 02:14:26,540
- What are you doing there?
- I built a house made of rocks!

1413
02:14:26,687 --> 02:14:28,907
- Out of rocks?
- Come, I want you to see it.

1414
02:14:29,152 --> 02:14:31,346
Can you make me one?

1415
02:14:31,398 --> 02:14:34,287
Come on, Daddy!

1416
02:14:35,287 --> 02:14:45,287
Good Bye... Subtitle Ripped by
